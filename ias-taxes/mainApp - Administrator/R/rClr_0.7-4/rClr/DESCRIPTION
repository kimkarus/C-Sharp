Description: rClr is a package for low-level access from R to a Common Language
    Runtime (CLR). The supported CLR implementations are Microsoft '.NET'
    framework on Windows and Mono on several platforms, currently Windows and
    at least Debian Linux. rClr has been used at least in scientific modelling
    work since 2013-06. Running it on Mono has been relatively experimental,
    but as of November 2014 several factors have enabled very near functional
    parity with the Windows/.NET.
